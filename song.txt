Blinkered against the harsh and raging sun
They said, divert your gaze: don't look behind
It was time, they said, to do that thing;
Mindful, they, of peace and peace of mind

Don't feel bad, they said, about the numbers
Don't feel bad about the melting heat
The burning flesh, the soft white cell demise
And the shattered ground beneath the trembling feet

Let's turn it on, yeah
Nobody is giving it up, yeah, yeah,
Everybody is living it up, yeah,
Everybody is living it up, living it up, let's turn it on,
Yeah, nobody is giving it up, everybody is living it up, yeah,
Everybody is living it up
Let's turn it on, turn it on, yeah,
Dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing

Well how come you say you will when you won't,
Say you do, baby, when you don't?
Let me know honey how you feel,
Tell the truth now, is love real?

But huh uh well honey don't, well honey don't,
honey don't, honey don't, honey don't
A-say you will when you won't, huh uh honey, don't.
