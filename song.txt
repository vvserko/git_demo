Blinkered against the harsh and raging sun
They said, divert your gaze: don't look behind
It was time, they said, to do that thing;
Mindful, they, of peace and peace of mind

Don't feel bad, they said, about the numbers
Don't feel bad about the melting heat
The burning flesh, the soft white cell demise
And the shattered ground beneath the trembling feet

One point.
